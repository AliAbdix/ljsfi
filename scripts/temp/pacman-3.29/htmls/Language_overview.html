    Pacman environments are defined by a simple language with syntax as follows.

The language is made from <i>atoms.</i>  An atom may either be
<ul>
<li> One of the function calls chosen from the available atomic functions.
<li> Any of the one-line statements from the Pacman 2 language.
</ul>
A statement in the language is either an atom, or 
<ul>
<li> A sequence of statements separated by semicolons or carriage returns.
<li> Text of the form <b>{ s1 OR s2 OR s3 OR ... OR sn }</b> where <b>s1, s2,...,sn</b> are
statements.
</ul>
Notice that this implies that you can nest semicolons and OR as in "<b> a; { b OR { c OR d; e } }; f </b>," etc.
As usual, lines can be continued with the backslash character and, as usual, the <b>#</b> character outside
of a quoted text causes the rest of the line to be taken as a comment.  Blank lines and
indentation are ignored.
<p>
Here is an example to give you an idea of what it looks like.
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
#  Sample of Pacman syntax.  Each such file defines a "package".
#
platformGE('linux-redhat-7.1')   # Require Red-Hat linux greater than or equal to 7.1
platformLE('linux-redhat-7.3')   # ...and less than or equal to 7.3.
gccVersionGT('2.8')              # tests for "native" gcc version greater than 2.8
which('configure'); which('make'); which('gcc')

download('http://xxxx/something.tar.gz')
untarzip('something.tar.gz')

cd('$PAC_TARBALLROOT')   # cd into the unzipped tarball
shell('./configure')     # configure some software
shell('./make')          # make some software
cd()                     # cd back

package('Pacman:nedit | versionGE("1.0")') # Requires another package at this point.
#
#  Set up a workspace
#
workspace("Bob's Sandbox",'BOB_LOCATION',1000,'bob','groupwrite')

{ yes('OK to send email?'); mail('youssef@bu.edu','hi') OR message('No email sent.') }

setenv     ('BOB_HOME','~bob')     # set an environment variable that will be part of a users's setup
setenvTemp ('BOB_TEMP','~bob/tmp') # set a temporary environment variable

message('Success!')</font></pre></b>
Such scripts must be put into text files with <b>pacman</b> extensions as in
<b>Sample.pacman</b>.  Each such file defines a "package."  
<p>
    You can think of a program like <b>Sample.pacman</b> as defining a sequence of conditions which Pacman may
(or may not) be able to establish.  If all of these conditions are established, in order, 
then "Sample" is "installed."  Pacman automatically keeps track of these
conditions over time and automatically has the ability to correctly "undo everything that was done."
<p>
    Before listing all of the (more than 160) atoms, there are a few general points to keep in mind:
<p>
<ul>
<li> You can include packages within packages recursively as indicated above. This is the main mechanism for
building complex environments.  
<li> Some atoms allow you to interact with the installer.  The <b><font color="#8B0000">yes</font></b> atom above, for
example, asks a yes or no question and is satisfied if the answer is "yes".  Pacman remembers the answers to these
questions, so that when a package is re-installed at a later date, the installer does not have to repeat the answers.
<li> In the <b><font color="#8B0000">OR</font></b> statement form, the branches are evaluated in order.  For example, the
statement
<pre>
<b><font color="#8B0000">{ yes('OK to send email?'); mail('youssef@bu.edu','hi') OR message('No email sent.') }</font></b>
</pre>
has the effect of first asking the question.  If the installer answers <i>yes</i>, the email is sent.  
If the installer answers <i>no</i>, then the alternative branch is attempted, the message is 'No email send.' is
displayed, and the installation continues.
<li> It is always best to avoid the various shell atoms whenever possible.  For instance, if you want to set an
environment variable <b>FOO</b> to <b>BAR</b>, it is much better to do
<pre>
<b><font color="#8B0000">setenv('FOO','BAR')</font></b>
</pre>
rather than
<pre>
<b><font color="#8B0000">shell('setenv FOO BAR')</font></b>
</pre>
In the second case (since shell commands are executed as sub-processes), the shell command will have no effect and would
also fail unless the installer was installing from the c-shell.  Another non-obvious reason has to do with gaining the
trust of someone who might install your software.  If a complex installation has many shell commands, then it may be
difficult for an installer to decide to go ahead with the procedure and trust that the shell commands will not do anything
harmful.  On the other hand, if there are only a few shell commands and everything else are non-shell Pacman atoms (which
are always safe to execute), then an installer can proceed with confidence or at least has fewer shell commands to look
over.
</ul>
You can find more extensive examples of real applications in the tutorials section.  Subsections
describe the atoms of the language and give small examples.
