     This depends on the license to a certain extend, but the combination of using
<ul>
<li> SSH and Globus caches to restrict access
<li> Questions to get user agreements that can be remembered
<li> Basic Pacman commands like <b>cat</b> and <b>mail</b>
</ul>
is hoped to be enough to smoothly handle licensed software so that it can be freely combined with
everything else.
