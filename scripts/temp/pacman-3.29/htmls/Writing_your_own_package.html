<h1><font color=navy>Writing your own Pacman packages</font></h1>
<p>
<hr size=5>
<p>
     This tutorial is meant to help you get started writing your own packages in Pacman 3.  As an example, we'll
go through the process of writing a package to install Python version 2.3.4 and it's documentation.
<p>
     Start by setting up Pacman in the usual way.  Make a subdirectory <b>cache/</b> to hold the Pacman source 
code and <b>work/</b> to test the installation.  Edit a file <b>cache/Python.pacman</b> so it contains
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
#  Sample Python 2.3.4 installation
#
#  author: {you}
#  date: {date}
#
</font></pre></b>
In the <b>work/</b> directory, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get ../cache:Python
% pacman -l -d src
[*] Python, source cache [../cache]
</font></pre></b>
to get started.
<p>
    In writing a package, you'll have a good point of view if you imagine that you have been blindfolded and lead to
a terminal session on an unknown computer running some unknown version of Unix.  Your job is to define all of the 
conditions necessary to insure that Python version 2.3.4 is correctly installed and setup on your unknown computer.
By taking this point of view, you will make your package nice and robustly self-contained.
<p>
     Before getting to the actual business of installing Python, let's add the following to <b>Python.pacman</b>.
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">packageName('Python')
url('Python','http://www.python.org')

version('2.3.4')
</font></pre></b>
The <b>packageName</b> atom fixes the name of the package to be "Python" even if you change the filename to something
like <b>Python-2.3.4.pacman</b> later on.  This lets you have different versions of Python described in different
files in the same cache directory.  The <b>url</b> atom is used to provide a convenient pointer for the installer
when Pacman generates web pages.  The <b>version('2.3.4')</b> atom sets the version string of this package to
<b>'2.3.4'</b>.  This allows the package to be conveniently selected among other possible Python installations.  To
try this, in the work area do:
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
% pacman -lc ../cache -d version
    [ ] Python, in cache [../cache]
               version = 2.3.4
% pacman -get "../cache:Python | version('2.3.4')"
% pacman -l -d src
[*] Python, source cache [../cache]
         [src] #
         [src] #  Sample Python 2.3.4 installation
         [src] #
         [src] #  author: {you}
         [src] #  date: {date}
         [src] #
         [src] packageName('Python')
         [src] url('Python','http://www.python.org')
         [src] 
         [src] version('2.3.4')
</font></pre></b>
to see that you have successfully selected a particular version.
<p>
     In this particular case, we're planning to install Python from it's sources taken from a tarball from
www.python.org.  This is a procedure that might work on any Unix platform as long as basic utilities like
<b>make</b>, <b>ld</b> and <b>gcc</b> are available and as long as, say 30 Megs of disk space is available.  
To make sure that this is true, add
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# -- Basic system requirements
#
platformGE('unix')
which('gcc'); which('ld'); which('make')
freeMegsMinimum(30)
</font></pre></b>
to <b>Python.pacman</b>.  To test what we've got so far, you can do <b>-remove</b> and <b>-get</b> as before or just
do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -update
% pacman -l
</font></pre></b>
To update to the newly modified version.
<p>
It may sometimes be helpful to do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -l -d cmp
[*] Python, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
        [*] AND
                [*] setcwd /home/youssef/Pacman/work
                [*] setenv temporary PACMAN_INSTALLATION => /home/youssef/Pacman/work
                [*] packageName Python
                [*] cache of origin ../cache
                [*] pacman source code Python.pacman
                [*] <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank"><font color=#000000>Python</font></a>
                [*] version = 2.3.4
                [*] platform >= unix
                [*] which gcc
                [*] which ld
                [*] which make
                [*] freeMegsMinimum 30 free Megabytes at .
                [*] setcwd /home/youssef/Pacman/work
</font></pre></b>
to view the compiled environmental conditions.  You will see "[*]" wherever the defined condition is satisfied.
<p>
     Now let's begin the actual installation by downloading the tarball from www.python.org.  To do this, just add
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# -- Prepare to do the installation
#
mkdir('python-2.3.4')
cd('python-2.3.4')
downloadUntarzip('http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3.4/Python-2.3.4.tgz','PYTHON_TAR')
mkdir('python')                               # directory which will contain the installed package
setenvTemp('PYTHON_LOCATION','$PWD/python')   # define a temporary environment variable
</font></pre></b>
to <b>Python.pacman</b>.  This code creates a working directory for the package and a directory which will hold the files created by
the Python make procedure (<b>python/</b>).  The <b>setenvTemp</b> atom defines a temporary environment variable which is available only
during the package installation and is not defined as part of the setup scripts.  The <b>downloadUntarzip</b> atom is a handy combined
download/untar which also sets a temporary environment variable <b>$PYTHON_TAR</b> to the path of the location of the top directory of
the untarred tarball.  Now we are ready to configure and install Python by adding
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# -- Install as usual
#
cd('$PYTHON_TAR')
shell('./configure --prefix="$PYTHON_LOCATION"')  # configure Python to install into the prepared directory
shell('make')
shell('make install')
cd()
</font></pre></b>
the <b>shell</b> atoms execute shell commands.  You should note a couple of things about shell commands: the <b>shell</b> atom does not
send the shell output to the installer's terminal.  This means that if you want to execute shell commands that ask questions, you should
use <b>shellDialogue</b>.  Also, keep in mind that shell commands cannot affect the environment of the Pacman process that is doing the
installation.  Setting environment variables in a shell script, for example, will not have an effect for the rest of the installation.
For more details about shell commands, see the <a href="Shells.html">shell section</a> of the language description.
<p>
This time, let's install step by step so that we can see the effect of each Pacman action.  To do this, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
% pacman -ask action -get ../cache:Python
</font></pre></b>
in your work area.  You will be asked permission before each Pacman action is taken.
<p>
   Assuming that you have gotten Python to install correctly, you only have to add
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# -- setup the user's environment
#
path('python/bin')
</font></pre></b>
to add the <b>bin/</b> area to the user/installer's path.  If your package is dependent on other packages, you just use the 
<b>package</b> or <b>configure</b> atoms as explained in the language syntax.  To try this out, add Python documentation to your package
by adding.
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# -- add Python standard documentation
#
package('Demo:PythonDocs | versionGE("2.3.4")')
</font></pre></b>
If you install this, you will see that the csh/sh/py/pl scripts now adjust your PATH variable to use the installed Python.
<p>
The complete package now reads
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
#  Sample Python 2.3.4 installation
#
#  author: {you}
#  date: {date}
#
packageName('Python')
url('Python','http://www.python.org')

version('2.3.4')
#
# -- Basic system requirements
#
platformGE('unix')
which('gcc'); which('ld'); which('make')
freeMegsMinimum(30)
#
# -- Prepare to do the installation
#
mkdir('python-2.3.4')
cd('python-2.3.4')
downloadUntarzip('http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3.4/Python-2.3.4.tgz','PYTHON_TAR')
mkdir('python')                               # directory which will contain the installed package
setenvTemp('PYTHON_LOCATION','$PWD/python')   # define a temporary environment variable

#
# -- Install as usual
#
cd('$PYTHON_TAR')
shell('./configure --prefix="$PYTHON_LOCATION"')  # configure Python to install into the prepared directory
shell('make')
shell('make install')
cd()

#
# -- Add the python binary directory to the users's path both during installation and in setup
#
path('python/bin')

#
# -- add Python standard documentation
#
package('Demo:PythonDocs | versionGE("2.3.4")')
</font></pre></b>
<p>
When you're finished writing a package, it is a good practice to confirm that it removes itself correctly if
you do <b>% pacman -remove</b>.  Pacman guarantees this for Pacman operations, but if a package uses a
script, you are responsible for making sure that this is cleaned up when your package is uninstalled.  You
may occasionally need the <b>uninstallShell</b> atom to do this.
<p>
The basic philosophy of Pacman is to guarantee all of the conditions that you desribe above over time.  For instance if you define an
environment variable with <b>setenv</b> Pacman will make sure that this is not overwritten by some other package.  In this case, for
example, you have put some binaries in the user's path.  If some other package puts other binaries with the same name in the user's path
(a different version of Python, for example), then Pacman will complain and refuse to create setup scripts for the installation.
