Suppose that you're managing a Pacman source cache that remote users have installed from.  You might want to change the contents of
your cache but only after doing some testing first.  There are several ways of dealing with this situation in Pacman (see the
tutorials).  One simple thing you can do is lock the cache so that remote users can't install or update from your cache while you
test the modified contents.  To do this, simply
<ol>
<li> Add a text file called <b>lock</b> to the top level directory of the cache. The first line of this file is an optional message
to your users.
<li> With the presence of the lock file, remote users will not be able to browse, install or update and will instead get an error
message incorporating your error message.
<li> Test the new contents of your cache as usual after doing
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -allow lock-override
</font></pre></b>
once.
</ol>
When you are done testing, just remove the <b>lock</b> file.
