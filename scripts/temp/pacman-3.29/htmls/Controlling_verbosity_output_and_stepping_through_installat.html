You've noticed by now that Pacman's default behavior is to give you messages when performing certain operations like
downloading files.  To control what messages you see, use the <b>-v</b> switch.  For example, if you do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -v http tar -get BU:Python
</font></pre></b>
you will see only <b>http</b> and <b>tar</b> related messages during the installation.  To see a complete list of such options, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -v help
</font></pre></b>
Each time you use a switch with options like <b>-v</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-ask</b>, etc., the options that you
choose are saved as defaults until you change them.  To see what the current defaults are, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -def
</font></pre></b>
You can also use
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -v none
</font></pre></b>
to turn off all of the options for such command line switches.
<p>
    Besides general verbosity, there is also a useful set of display options associated just with the <b>-l</b> and <b>-lc</b>
commands.  For example, suppose you want to see the version numbers of all packages in the <b>BU</b> cache.  You do this with
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -d version -lc BU
</font></pre></b>
Similarly, <b>-d help</b> gives a complete list of choices.
<p>
   If you are debugging some Pacman code or if you want to install cautiously, you might want to step through an
installation.  Pacman 3 let's you do this using the <b>-ask</b> command line switch.  For example, make a new installation using
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -ask action -get BU:Python
</font></pre></b>
The <b>action</b> option asks your permission before performing any action defined in the Pacman language.  As usual,
you can get a list of options for <b>-ask</b> by doing <b>% pacman -ask help</b>.  When debugging, cautious or just
curious, it is often useful to use
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -ask shell -install
</font></pre></b>
This causes Pacman to stop and ask permission before executing any shell command defined in the language.  A more
verbose approach is to do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -ask shell-all -install
</font></pre></b>
This will also ask permission whenever Pacman needs to execute a shell command, even for internal reasons.
