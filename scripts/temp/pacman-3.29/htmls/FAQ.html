<h2><li>How do I get help or report bugs?</h2><br>
Questions, bug reports, suggestions and ideas are always welcome by email to 
<a href="mailto:youssef@bu.edu">Saul Youssef</a>.  
<h2><li>Is Pacman 3 compatible with previous versions of Pacman?</h2><br>
Yes, all the existing Pacman 2 caches will work as they are.  You cannot,
however, add Pacman 3 packages to an existing Pacman 2 installation.  Instead,
you should re-install with Pacman 3.
<h2><li>Where is the list of symbolic cache names?  Can I modify it?</h2><br>
Do <b>% pacman -registry</b> to see the default list of symbolic cache names.
Authors of Pacman packages can define their own names which are added to your registry when you install
the software.  See the documentation for the <b>register</b> atom of the Pacman language for more
details.
<h2><li>Does Pacman modify files outside of the installation directory
tree?</h2><br>
Packages usually keep to the good practice of staying within the directory tree
that Pacman creates for them.  In general, however, a package may modify files
outside of it's directory tree.  Because of this, you should always use <b>% pacman -remove</b> to remove
packages rather than doing <b>% rm -r -f </b>.
<h2><li>Am I allowed to modify and re-distribute Pacman?</h2><br>
Not without explicit permission from Saul Youssef.  See <b>% pacman
-license</b> for the details.
