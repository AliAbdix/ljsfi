We have installed some software, but, so far, there has been no mention of
software "versions."  In Pacman, the concepts of "versions," "releases numbers,"
"tags" etc. are special cases of a general way of specifying package
requirements.  In Pacman, you can specify packages with an optional
expression of requirments in the form of 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get "{package specification} | {requirements}"
</font></pre></b>
where <b>{requirements}</b> is just any expression in the same language used to
desribe Pacman environments.  The double quotes in the command line are (unfortunately) required so that the
vertical bar is not interpreted as a pipe.  This is discussed further in the documentation, but for now, let's do a
few typical example uses.
<p>
  Suppose that we are interested in installing a version of
Python greater than version 2.2.  You can start like this
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -d version -lc BU
</font></pre></b>
to display all the packages in the cache BU showing the version numbers if any.  Having founded a version of Python
that you like, you might want to do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -d src -l "BU:Python | versionGE('2.2')"
</font></pre></b>
to browse the source code of a Python package that satisfies your requirements.  You can then do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get  "BU:Python | versionGE('2.2')"
</font></pre></b>
to install the same package.  To "get" exactly version 2.3.3 of Python, do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get  "BU:Python | version('2.3.3')"
</font></pre></b>
To get some version of Python between 2.1 and less than 2.3, do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get  "BU:Python | versionGE('2.1'); versionLT('2.3')"
</font></pre></b>
<p>
These "version" numbers actually have no intrinsic meaning to Pacman.  They are just character strings with lexical
ordering.  Authors of Pacman packages can add version strings, and/or "release" strings and/or "tag" strings to any
of their packages as they like. A typical use of "tag", for example, is to distinguish debug versions of packages. 
One might, then use something like
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get  "BU:Foo | version('1.0'); tag('debug')"
</font></pre></b>
to specify which "tag" you want.
