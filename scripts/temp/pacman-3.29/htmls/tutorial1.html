New features in Pacman 3 gives you options for backing up cahces, redistributing caches and controlling 
how and when updates appear at remote sites.  This tutorial gets you started with a few simple examples.
<p>
<h2><font color=navy>Scenario</font></h2>
<p>
For the purpose of this tutorial, let's pretend that you are part of a project that is interested
in using software from the <b>Demo</b> cache.  The simplest possibility is to just use the
<b>Demo</b> cache directly as in the examples in the users guide.  However, suppose that
<ul>
<li> <b>Demo</b> is under control of software developers who change the content of the cache fairly
often.  You would like to use this software, but you don't want updates to appear at your various
installations every time something changes in <b>Demo</b>.  <i>You</i> want to be able to decide when these changes occur.
<li> You want backups of the <b>Demo</b> cache in case of emergencies.
<li> If a problem appears in the <b>Demo</b> cache, you want to be able to fix it quickly if it is urgent but then go back to the
standard <b>Demo</b> contents over time and you want to do all this without causing major disruptions or changes in procedures at
your remote installations.
</ul>
This is easy to do with Pacman 3.  Let's see how.
<p>
To start, make two working directories <b>work</b> and <b>cache</b> working directory and make a file called 
<b>cache/myDemo.caches</b> containing
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# - Sample cache showing how to re-distribute Demo
#
Demo
</font></pre></b>
By making a file called <b>myDemo.Caches</b>, you have created a cache which is at least accessible
via your local file system.  To see this, cd into <b>work</b> and do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -lc ../cache/myDemo.caches
</font></pre></b>
and you'll see the contents of the cache displayed.  For the purposes of this example, that's enough, but in a real
situation you would probably want to put this file in a web visible directory and access it by something like
<b>% pacman -lc http://yourmachine/~yourname/work/myDemo.caches</b>.
Depending on the situation, you might alternatively want to address the cache via <b>gsiftp://...</b> or via SSH in the
standard file location syntax.
<p>
So far, you haven't done much.  If your users install something through <b>myDemo.caches</b> by doing, for example,
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get ../cache/myDemo.caches:Choice
% pacman -d up -l
[*] Choice, update from [../cache/myDemo.caches]
</font></pre></b>
they will get the same content as in the
<b>Demo</b> cache at Boston University.  An update will appear at their installations whenever <b>Choice.pacman</b> in the 
<b>Demo</b> cache changes.  Now, however, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -snap Demo
% mv *.snap ../cache/Demo1.snap
% pacman -lc ../cache/Demo1.snap
</font></pre></b>
and add a line to <b>myDemo.caches</b> so it contains
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# - Sample cache showing how to re-distribute Demo
#
../cache/Demo1.snap
Demo
</font></pre></b>
Now open another shell where you pretend to be a user of your cache.  In a new working directory <b>work2</b>, browse your cache
and install the <b>Choice</b> package like so
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -lc ../cache/myDemo.caches
% pacman -remove
% pacman -get ../cache/myDemo.caches:Choice
% pacman -d in up -l
</font></pre></b>
The <b>-d in up</b> displays the update cache as well as the cache that the package is in (your installation, in this case).  You
should see that <b>Choice</b> is updated from <b>myDemo.caches</b> rather than directly from <b>Demo</b>.   You have already
achieved two of the goals of the tutorial:
<ol>
<li> You have a self contained, machine independent backup of <b>Demo</b>.
<li> Your installers will not see update appear at their installations until changes appear in new snapshots as you make new
snapshots.
</ol>
Do this a couple of more times, making <b>Demo2.snap</b>, <b>Demo3.snap</b> as shown in the following figure.
<p>
<img src="fig1.gif" height=500 width=700>
<p>
This technique works recursively, so that other cache lists can point to <b>myDemo.caches</b>, etc.  Your users can always browse
the entire contents of your cache.  If they desire, they can also install from a specific snapshot or from <b>Demo</b>.  They can
do this either directly or via
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
% pacman -get ../cache/myDemo.caches:Demo1.snap:Choice
% pacman -remove
% pacman -fetch ../work/myDemo.caches:Demo:Choice
% pacman -remove
% pacman -fetch Demo:Choice
</font></pre></b>
and so on.
<p>
You can also hide this entire apparatus inside a single package.  To illustrate this, make a directory <b>../cache</b> and put a
file in it <b>myChoice.pacman</b> containing
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000"># 
#  -- A Pacman package hiding the whole updating and re-distribution mechanism of this tutorial
#
package('../cache/myDemo.caches:Choice')
message('Installed!')
</font></pre></b>
Now, anyone who has read access can do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
% pacman -get ../cache:myChoice
</font></pre></b>
as usual.  Although the details are hidden, you are providing software from <b>Demo</b> in standard Pacman fashion while still
controlling if and when updates appear for your users.
<p>
<h3><font color=navy>Handling an emergency fix</font></h3>
<p>
Let's now suppose that you have many users who have installed <b>Choice</b> via your cache.  You suddenly have a need to change
this package, but you want to do this in a way that doesn't disrupt the remote installations and doesn't interfere with the owners
of <b>Demo</b>.  Do to this, make an <b>../emergency</b> area, cd to it and do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -extract-sources Demo
% pacman -remove-all
</font></pre></b>
to extract the Pacman source code from <b>Demo</b> (and remove the installation debris).  You can now edit, say <b>Choice.pacman</b>, and add to <b>myDemo.caches</b>
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# - Sample cache showing how to re-distribute Demo
#
../emergency/
../cache/Demo4.snap
../cache/Demo3.snap
../cache/Demo2.snap
Demo
</font></pre></b>
Once you edit this file, your users with remote installations will see an update for <b>Choice.pacman</b> appear when they do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -update-check
</font></pre></b>
as usual.  You can update this way and go back to re-use the contents of <b>Demo</b> once they have fixed the problem as usual by
making a snapshot and changing <b>myDemo.cache</b> to
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">#
# - Sample cache showing how to re-distribute Demo
#
../cache/Demo5.snap
../emergency/
../cache/Demo4.snap
../cache/Demo3.snap
../cache/Demo2.snap
Demo
</font></pre></b>
From the point of view of your users, nothing has happened other than a sequence identical update operations.
<p>
Pacman 2 provided a mechanism for delegating installation and configuration to trusted experts who control Pacman caches.  
<ul>
<li> <i><b>With Pacman 3, you also are able to delegate updating decisions to trusted experts.</b></i>
</ul>
These mechanisms allow a large base of software coming from many sources to be smoothly managed in a convenient hierarchy which
does not complicate the situation from the point of view of an installing user.
