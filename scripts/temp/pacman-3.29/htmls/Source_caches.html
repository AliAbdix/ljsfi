A "source cache" in Pacman is basically a URL or location in your file system containing Pacman source
code (files ending in ".pacman").  A typical example is the <b>BU</b> cache.  If you do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -registry
</font></pre></b>
You will see that the symbolic name BU is mapped to a URL and you'll see information about who manages
this cache.  If you open this URL in your web browser, you'll see that it's just a directory
tree containing Pacman source code files.  
<p>
The main difference in source caches in Pacman 3 are:
<ol>
<li> You can access source caches via SSH and Globus as well as via http.
<li> The symbolic cache names like <b>BU</b> can be defined in the language.
<li> Different versions of a package may appear in the same cache with different file names.
</ol>
As before, the manager of a cache may use subdirectories.  A typical good use of subdirectories is to
put typically installed top level packages at the top and put dependent packages in subdirectories.
