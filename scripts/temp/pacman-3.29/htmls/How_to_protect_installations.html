One way to do this is to use <a href="basic.html">watch</a>.  If you do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">watch('myDirectory')
</font></pre></b>
for example, Pacman will absorb the directory tree <b>myDirectory/...</b> into the environment that it watches over.  The
<b>'time'</b> argument means that Pacman will save the time stamps of all the files in the tree.  In this case, when an
installer does
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000"> % pacman -verify
</font></pre></b>
Pacman will check that none of the files have been modified.
<p>
      In Pacman, if your package environment needs package Foo and you want to be sure that your package will be
re-installed if Foo ever changes, the normal thing do do is
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000"> % configure('Foo')
</font></pre></b>
If "Foo" is, on the other hand, non-Pacman installed software, you can do something similar by using <i>watch</i>
to absorb the contents of Foo into your environment.
