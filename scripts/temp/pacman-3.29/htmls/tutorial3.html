   This tutorial continues from the previous tutorial in order to make a few additional points about
cache hierarchies and how cache lists, snapshots and updating all work together.
<p>
<h3><font color=navy>Cache hierarchies</font></h3>
<p>
Let's begin by asking who should maintain the Pacman cache for a particular body of software?  Ideally, this will
be the developers of the software since they know best how to install and configure their own software.  Given
trust in these caches, installers gain the ability to use any consistent combination of this software that they
like.  Pacman provides the mechanism for installing, configuring and setting up software and for checking
consistency.  Although this setup is very helpful, if you start to use a diverse enough body of software, the
problem will be that so many updates become available that it will be difficult to decide whether to take a
particular update or not.  Also, if a research project decides to use one of these developer caches, they often
want to have coordinated updating of their sites and don't necessarily want to do this every time a developer
updates their Pacman caches. 
<p>
   As discussed in the previous tutorial, this problem can be neatly solved by using cache lists to delegate the
the decision about when updates appear at sites.  If the sites involved in a particular project install from a
common cache list, then the person controlling the cache list can decide when updates from the developer caches
should appear at the project's various installations.  This happens without disturbing the developers and it
presents a very simple picture to the installers: accept all updates as they appear.  In the previous tutorial, we
showed how this works for a cache list pointing to snapshots of a particular cache.  Here we practice a little bit
more showing that you can make hierarchies of cache lists as deep as you like, that you can make snapshots of
snapshots and point out that snapshots capture cache hierarchies to arbitrary depths.
<p>
Take the caches setup in the previous tutorial, and make three
caches files <b>A.caches</b>, <b>B.caches</b>, <b>C.caches</b> where <b>A.caches</b> points to <b>B.caches</b>
which points to <b>C.caches</b>, which points to <b>myDemo.caches</b> which ultimately points to <b>Demo</b>.
This represents a hierarchy of caches where usually different people will be maintaining <b>A,B,C.caches</b>
over time.  Now practice installing Python in various ways with
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get A.caches:Python
% pacman -get A.caches:Demo:Python
% pacman -get B.caches:C.caches:Demo:Python
% pacman -get A.caches:Demo:Python
</font></pre></b>
to see that they work.  When you do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get A.caches:C.caches:Python
</font></pre></b>
for example, you are specifying both where <b>Python</b> comes from and how it is updated.  When searching for an update of
Python, pacman will again go through <b>A.caches</b> and <b>B.caches</b> and so the people controlling <b>A.caches</b> and
<b>B.caches</b> can determine if and when an update of Python appears available to you.  On the other hand, you always have
the ability to install Python directly or to specify the whole search path
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get A.caches:B.caches:C.caches:myDemo.caches:Demo:Python
</font></pre></b>
To show that this works nicely with snapshots, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -snap A.caches
</font></pre></b>
as illustrated below.

<p>
Since the snapshot preserves the hierarchy of caches, you can still do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get A.snap:A.caches:C.caches:Python
</font></pre></b>
as before.  Snapshots effectively capture arbitrary cache hierarchies.
