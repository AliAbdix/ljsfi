It is fairly common to be in a situation where you want to be able to use any of
several different versions of the same software.  The problem with this in
Pacman is that different versions of the same software typically are
incompatible in the sense that they use the same environment variables, put the
same binaries in the users path etc.  Nevertheless, you can have multiple
versions of the same software in an installation and chose which version that
you want to actually setup and use.  This tutorial illustrates a number of
points:
<ul>
<li> How to specify different versions of the same Package
<li> How to install multiple versions of the same software in the same
installation.
<li> How Pacman unifies setup as well as installation and configuration.
</ul>
The example we will use is different versions of Python as available in the
<b>Demo</b> cache.  As we will be doing multiple installs, let's begin by making
a snapshot so that things go faster.  Do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -snap Demo
</font></pre></b>
If you browse the snapshot with
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -d version -lc Demo.snap
</font></pre></b>
You'll see that there are three versions of Python packages in the snapshot.
<p>
Now let's see what happens if you proceed naively and <b>-get</b> multiple versions of Python.  First try
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get "Demo.snap:Python | version ('2.1.3')"
% pacman -l
[*] Python, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
           version = 2.1.3
    [*] PythonDocs, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
               version = 2.1.3
</font></pre></b>
Now, however, if you install another version you will see something like this
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get "Demo.snap:Python | version('2.2.3')"
Package [Demo.snap:Python] not [installed]:
    Can't add [/home/youssef/Pacman/work/python-2.1.3/python-2.1.3/bin] to path variable [PATH]
        Path [pydoc] in also in [/home/youssef/Pacman/work/python-2.2.3/python-2.2.3/bin].
        Path [python] in also in [/home/youssef/Pacman/work/python-2.2.3/python-2.2.3/bin].
        Path [python2] in also in [/home/youssef/Pacman/work/python-2.2.3/python-2.2.3/bin].
</font></pre></b>
This is Pacman's way of telling you that there there there is a clash between packages.  In this particular case,
both Python packages add their <b>/bin</b> directories to the standard Unix <b>$PATH</b> with a Pacman <b>path</b>
statement.  The two bin directories both contain <b>pydoc</b>, <b>python</b> and <b>python2</b> and one or the
other will be ignored.  To see how to solve this, let's start again by first doing 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
</font></pre></b>
and then <b>-install</b>-ing the three packages one at a time rather than using <b>-get</b>.  Do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -install "Demo.snap:Python | version('2.1.3')"
% pacman -install "Demo.snap:Python | version('2.2.3')"
% pacman -install "Demo.snap:Python | version('2.3.4')"
</font></pre></b>
and you will find that this works.  The reason is that <b>-get</b> attempts to create a coherent total environment
for the installation and create setup scripts while <b>-install</b> does not.  Now you have three versions of
Python installed in your installation.  How, however, to do you set up to use a particular version?  The answer is
shown in the figure.

<p>
If the installation you have created is <b>../work</b>, cd elsewhere and do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get "../work:Python | version('2.2.3')"
</font></pre></b>
just as if you were installing the software.  Although nothing is actually installed, Pacman creates a consistent
environment for you, using the contents of <b>../work</b> and creates setup scripts that do the right things to use
the software in the original installation.
<p>
     This tutorial illustrates the sense in which "setting up" software is a special case of installation from the
Pacman point of view.  With Pacman, installation, configuration and setup are all done with within the same
framework.
