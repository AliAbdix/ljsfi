The most basic operations of "getting" and removing packages is often all you need to know about Pacman
to get software that you are interested in.  Sometimes, however, it helps to have finer controls over
these operations.  This is provided by
<ul>
<li> <b>-fetch</b>.  This fetches Pacman information from remote caches and resolves any dependencies and
evaluates whether the packages can be installed on your system.  The advantage of first doing
<b>-fetch</b> is that if there are several problems preventing a complicated installation, you can see
all of the problems before having to repeatedly attempt to do the installation.
<li> <b>-install</b>.  The <b>-install</b> switch has the same effect as <b>-fetch</b> but then also attempts to install
the packages that you have indicated on the command line.  If the installation fails, the reasons for the failure will be
displayed on the command line. 
<li> <b>-setup</b>.  The <b>-setup</b> switch produces a combined environment using all of the software in your installation.  If
this is consistent, it produces scripts <b>setup.csh</b>, <b>setup.sh</b> and <b>setup.py</b> which set up a user to use all of
the software installed in the installation.
</ul>
Let's try this now.  For example, make a new work area and try
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -fetch BU:nEdit Pacman:Pacman
% pacman -l
[ ] nEdit, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
[ ] Pacman, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
</font></pre></b>
this tells you that all dependencies have been resolved and that you may be able to do the installation.  To install the packages,
you can do <font color="#8B0000"><b>% pacman -install BU:nEdit Pacman:Pacman</b></font> or simply
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -install
</font></pre></b>
to install all of the top level packages in the installation.  You will then see
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -l
[*] nEdit, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
[*] Pacman, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
</font></pre></b>
that the installation has worked but no setup scripts have appeared.  Finally, do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -setup
</font></pre></b>
and you will see that the setup scripts appear.  To avoid confusion, <b>-setup</b> always applies to an entire installation, so if you see setup scripts, it
automatically means that Pacman has concluded that all of the software in the installation has successfully installed and that the packages are consistent.  
<p>
Part of the point of separating <b>-setup</b> is to allow installations that contain inconsistent packages.  This is useful, for example, if you want to have
a single installation that contains multiple incompatible versions of the same package.  See the versions section for of the documentation for more details
about this.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>-get</b> is the same as <b>-fetch</b> followed by <b>-install</b> and <b>-setup</b>.
<li> <b>-uninstall</b> lets you uninstall individual packages without removing them from the local installation.  
<li> <b>-remove</b> lets you remove the indicated list of packages from an installation entirely.
<li> <b>-remove-all</b> lets you remove all packages in an installation.
</ul>
For practice, try <b>-uninstall</b> on various package in your installation and then do <b>% pacman -install</b> or <b>% pacman -get</b> to re-install.
