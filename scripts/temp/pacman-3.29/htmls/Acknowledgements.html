    Pacman is meant as a solution to a messy, amorphous, annoying problem that has plagued research projects that I have
been involved with for many years.  The current state of the software has been strongly influenced by meeting the
particular needs of the U.S. ATLAS testbed, by Miron Livny's VDT group, by the iVDGL WorldGrid and Grid3 projects, by the needs
of the LCG group and by the huge ATLAS software installations.
<p>
I'd like to particularly thank some of the people who have helped with this project in one way or another, roughly in order of
appearance:
