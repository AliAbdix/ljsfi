Grab a copy of Pacman from <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/" target="_blank">Pacman
Headquarters</a>.  Unzip/tar it someplace, cd into the directory and do <b>% source setup.csh</b>
or <b>% source setup.sh</b> depending on your shell. cd to a scratch directory somewhere and do 
<b>% pacman -version</b> to make sure that you have Pacman version 3.0 or greater.
You're now ready to use Pacman.  
<p>
At the user level, Pacman has two main concepts: <i>Packages</i> and <i>Caches</i>.  
<dl>
<dt><h2><font color=navy>Packages</font></h2></dt>
<dd>A <i>package</i> is a description of a software environment in the <a href="Language_overview.html">Pacman language</a>. 
A package may be a single piece of software like <b>Python v 2.2.3</b> or a complex multi-package environment.
</dd>
<dt><h2><font color=navy>Caches</font></h2></dt>
<dd>A <i>cache</i> is a source of packages.</dd>
</dl>
An easy way to get familiar with packages and caches is to install some software.  Let's start with a nice text editing application
called <b>nEdit</b>.  The package <b>nEdit</b> can be found in the cache <b>BU</b>.  To get this software, all you have to do is
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get BU:nEdit
</font></pre></b>
Assuming that you agree to trust the cache <b>BU</b> (see below), installation may take from a few seconds to a few minutes to finish, depending on your internet connection.  If the installation succeeds, you will have
<b>nEdit</b> available to you.  If the installation fails, you will get an error message.  Here we come to an important point about Pacman - what to
do if an installation fails:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#8B0000"><i><b>If a Pacman installation or configuration or setup fails without giving you a sensible error message,
don't try to fix the installation yourself.  Instead, you should complain to the person who manages the cache that you are using and quit!
</b></i></font>
<p>
</ul>
If you follow this principle, then problems can be solved once for everyone by a cache manager rather than everyone repeatedly running into the same
problems.  The best way to help is to just complain and wait for a solution.  In the case of registered caches, you can get a list of 
who to complain to by doing <b>% pacman -registry</b>.  
<p>
Notice, also, that you had to indicate that you trusted the cache <b>BU</b> before Pacman would do anything.  This is necessary because Pacman is
downloading and executing instructions from the cache and executing them.  In general, then, 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#8B0000"><i><b>Only agree to trust a cache if you are sure of it's location and management.
</b></i></font>
<p>
</ul>
Pacman provides several tools for you to gain confidence in remote caches.  For example, you can browse the source code before it is executed (see <b>-l</b> and
<b>-lc</b> below).  You can also execute the installation one step at a time using <b>-ask</b>.  Caches can also be accessed via ssh rather than http
where access and authentication is handled by the standard ssh mechanisms.
<p>
In any case, try the <b>nEdit</b> install and while it's downloading, notice the following points:
<ol>
<li> All Pacman operations are accomplished by doing <b>% pacman</b> with various unix-style command-line options.  You can see
what the options are by doing <b>% pacman -help</b>.
<li> Pacman keeps a registry of symbolic names like "<b>BU</b>" which get translated to URLs. 
You can use full URLs instead of symbolic names if you like or if you want to trust a cache that's not in the
registry.  Do <b>% pacman -registry</b> to see your current set of symbolic names.
<li> The <b>-get</b> part of the command line tells Pacman to fetch, install and setup the packages that you specify on the
command line.  For command line options, do <b>% pacman -help</b>.
<li> Pacman asks you if you trust <b>BU</b> before proceeding.  Pacman will only use a cache if you
agree to trust it.  The list of caches that you are currently trusting is kept in a file called <b>trusted.caches</b> in your
current directory.  Pacman will modify this file as you agree to trust more caches, but you can also edit the file
yourself at any time.  If you do not specify a cache on the command line, Pacman will search the caches in the 
<b>trusted.caches</b> file in order.
<li> While the command is executing, several messages appear in your shell related to downloading, untarring,
and so on.  You can adjust what kinds of messages you get using the <b>-v</b> switch.  Do 
<b>% pacman -v help</b> to see the options.
<li> Pacman commands always refer to the installation in the current working directory.  To add and remove
packages to this installation, you must <b>% cd</b> to this location.
</ol>
If the installation of <b>BU:nEdit</b> succeeds, you will see that your directory now contains six files 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% ls
o..pacman..o  nedit-5.3  setup.csh  setup.py  setup.sh  trusted.caches
</font></pre></b>
Besides the <b>trusted.caches</b> file, Pacman also produces and maintains <b>setup.csh</b>, 
<b>setup.sh</b> and <b>setup.py</b>. 
To set up whatever software you have installed, just source <b>setup.csh</b> or 
<b>setup.sh</b> depending on your shell.  In this particular case, source the appropriate setup file and you can then 
do <b>% nEdit</b> to use the editor.  Each installation has at most one set of setup files.  Sourcing the appropriate
file (from any location) always sets up all of the software contained in your installation.  You shouldn't edit these
files by hand because they are regenerated by Pacman.
<p>
Finally the "<b>o..pacman..o</b>" file let's you know that the current directory 
contains a Pacman installation.  It's actually a directory containing Pacman's internal representation of your environment.
<p>
     Now let's add some more software to your installation with the following command
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get BU:Python nEdit Pacman:Pacman
</font></pre></b>
and notice that
<ol>
<li> You can specify multiple packages on the command line.
<li> <b>Python</b> depends on another package called <b>PythonDocs</b> which is automatically installed when you install Python.
<li> It does no harm if you already have <b>nEdit</b> installed.
<li> The package <b>Pacman</b> from the cache <b>Pacman</b> is a convenient way to treat <b>Pacman</b> in the same way that you treat
any other package.  After doing this, you can throw away your original untarred copy of Pacman.
</ol>

The <b>-l</b> command line switch let's you browse the contents of your installation.  For instance, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -l
[*] Python, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
    [*] PythonDocs, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
[*] nEdit, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
[*] Pacman, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
</font></pre></b>
to see a dependency tree view of the packages in your installation.
The boxed character in front of each package indicates it's status. The "<b><font color="#8B0000">[*]</font></b>" mean that each of the package has
successfully installed.  A package which can't be intalled on your system is indicated by "<b><font color="#8B0000">[X]</font></b>" and 
"<b><font color="#8B0000">[ ]</font></b>" indicates a package which might install correctly but the installation hasn't been attempted.
In general, commands of the form <b>% pacman -l {package 1} {package 2}...</b> let you browse packages in your installation
with display options controlled by the <b>-d</b> switch.  For example, try
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -d src -l Python
</font></pre></b>
to list the source code of the <b>Python</b> package and it's dependents.  You can also list all the packages in your 
installation cache in alphabetic order by doing <font color="#8B0000"><b>% pacman -lc .</b></font>.

You can use same <b>-l</b> and <b>-lc</b> commands to browse remote caches as well.  For example 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -d 2 -l VDT:Condor
[ ] Condor, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]
    [ ] Condor-Installer, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]
        [ ] Condor-Environment, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]...
        [ ] Condor-Base, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]...
        [ ] VDT-Common, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]...
        [ ] VDT-Environment, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]...
        [ ] Licenses, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]...
    [ ] Condor-Environment, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]
        [ ] VDT-Common, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]...
        [ ] VDT-Environment, in cache [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_cache/]...
</font></pre></b>
displays the package <b>Condor</b> from the cache <b>VDT</b> to maximum depth <b>2</b>, and 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -lc BU
</font></pre></b>
lists the contents of the <b>BU</b> cache.
<p>
<h3><font color=navy>Removing packages</font></h3>
<p>
When removing packages, it is important to use the Pacman mechanisms for this rather then just doing <b>% rm -r -f </b> in the
installation area.  The reason for this is that, in general, Pacman packages may modify files outside of your installation area.  To see if this
is true, use
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -domain
</font></pre></b>
and you will see all parts of your system Pacman has modified or is keeping track of.  To remove software correctly, use, for example,
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
</font></pre></b>
This removes all packages from your installation recursively.  See <b>% pacman -help</b> for more details.
<p>
Finally, when you are done, do
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove-all
</font></pre></b>
to remove all packages in your installation and remove the installation itself.
