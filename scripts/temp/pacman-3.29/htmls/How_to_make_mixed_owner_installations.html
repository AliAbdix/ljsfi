    Although in the unix tradition, software is usually installed as <i>root</i>, this is often very
undersirable, particularly for grid or distributed computing situations.  On the other hand, software
occasionally really does have to be installed as root.  If you have a large software environment that
has a small root requiring part, there are a couple of mechanisms in Pacman that are meant to help with
this:
<ul>
<li> You can use <b>cu</b> to change username only during the parts of the installation where this is
really necessary.  You can, for example, do 
<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">cu('root'); package('RootRequiringPackage'); cu()
</font></pre></b>
to "change username" just for the installation of <b>RootRequiringPackage</b>.  The advantage of this
is that updates of the overall environment can be performed by a non-root user unless the root
requiring package itself changes.
<p>
<li> You can ask your system administrator to make a Pacman installation containing the root requiring
packages and then use this installation as a cache.
</ul>
