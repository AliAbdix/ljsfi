   Pacman allows you to make a machine independent, self-contained, self-installing, un-updateable 
"pacball" script from any package.  Given a pacball, installing the package consists of just executing
the pacball script.  This means that installers don't need to use Pacman and don't need to have
internet access.  Let's see how it works...
<p>
To to a fresh working directory and do<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -pacball Demo:Test</font></pre></b>
when this is finished, you'll find a file<pre><b><font color="#8B0000">Test.md5-8005fc0df87dda07c5c147389ea453d3.sh</font></pre></b>
This file is the self-installing pacball script for <b>Demo:Test</b>.  To install <b>Test</b>, simply execute this script in
any fresh directory.  Because pacballs and their resulting installations can't be updated, pacballs provide a convenient
way of archiving software environments.  Because of this, an md5-checksum of the contents of the file is included in the
name of all pacballs to uniquely identify the software.
<p>
    Given a pacball such as <b>Test.md5-8005fc0df87dda07c5c147389ea453d3.sh</b> an optional argument allows you to install
any package contained in it individually, for instance<pre><b><font
color="#8B0000">Test.md5-8005fc0df87dda07c5c147389ea453d3.sh Pacman</font></pre></b> will, in this case, install just
Pacman.  
<p>
When creating a pacball, the optional argument <b>-default PACKAGE_NAME</b> let's you specify which package is
installed by default when the pacball script is executed.
<p>
On some systems, if a pacball is greater than 2G in size an error to the effect "script too large" will
occur when you try to execute the pacball.  If this happens, using "% bash <b>script</b>" instead of "%
<b>script</b>" will work.
