<h1><font color=navy>Questions asked during installations</font></h1>

    During Pacman installations, you may get asked questions about configuration or how the installation
proceeds.  Pacman has the ability to save the answers to these questions so that if you reinstall or update
software, you don't have to answer the questions all over again.  Here's a simple example showing how this
works.  Do
<b><pre><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -get Demo:Choice
</font></pre></b>
You will be asked a few questions which you should answer any way you like.  Now do
<b><pre><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -l -d cmp
</font></pre></b>
and you will see something like this
<b><pre><font color="#8B0000">[*] Choice, in cache [/home/youssef/Pacman/work]
        [*] AND
                [*] setcwd /home/youssef/Pacman/work
                [*] setenv temporary PACMAN_INSTALLATION => /home/youssef/Pacman/work
                [*] packageName Choice
                [*] cache of origin Demo
                [*] pacman source code Choice.pacman
                [*] OR
                        [ ] AND
                                [ ] choice Asked [Choose a color] chosen [red] from ['red', 'green', 'blue'] user chose [blue].
                                [ ] user message "Red"
                        [ ] AND
                                [ ] choice Asked [Choose a color] chosen [green] from ['red', 'green', 'blue'] user chose [blue].
                                [ ] user message "Green"
                        [*] AND
                                [*] choice Asked [Choose a color] chosen [blue] from ['red', 'green', 'blue'] user chose [blue].
                                [*] user message "Blue"
                [*] OR
                        [*] AND
                                [*] choice Asked [OK to print "hello"?] chosen [y] from ['y', 'n'] user chose [y].
                                [*] user message "hello"
                        [ ] true
                [*] setenv USER_CHOICE => AAAAA
                [*] user message "Done with choices"
                [*] setcwd /home/youssef/Pacman/work

</font></pre></b>
to see how your choices have determined what happened during the installation.  Now do
<b><pre><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
% pacman -get Demo:Choice
</font></pre></b>
and you will see that the installation proceeds assuming the answers that you gave the first time.  To
re-install ignoring the previous answers, do
<b><pre><font color="#8B0000">% pacman -remove
% pacman -get Demo:Choice -ignore-cookies
</font></pre></b>
and you will see that you get asked the questions again. 
<p>
Of course, this only applies to questions which are asked using the Pacman language rather than via executing
a shell script.
